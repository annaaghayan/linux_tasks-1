* Create at least three new users. I will refer to them as U1, U2 and U3, but you should choose other, realistic usernames. Set their passwords to different values, but don't use passwords that you actually use in other systems.
* Create at least one new group, where at least two users are in that group, and at least one user is not in that group. I will refer to the group as G1 but you should choose a realistic group name.
* Create some directories and files inside each users home.
* Configure access control so that:
    * No other user can access U1's files or directories
    * U2 has a directory that all members of G1 can view and create files in. Other files and directories of U2 are not accessible by other users.
    * All users can view U3's files.
    * If the above does not specify all requirements, then the default permissions (set when the users were created) can be used.
* Test that the access control works by logging in as each user and checking they can(not) access the specified files/directories.
